	<h2>The “Superiority” of the Northeast United States</h2>
	<h4>By Allison Chapin</h4>
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
	<p>Anyone who lives in the Northeastern United States is probably familiar with the narrative of the North before and during the Civil War: the Northern states all freed their slaves because owning other human beings is wrong, and the people in those states recognized that. Their moral stance on this led to increasing tensions with the American South, and lo and behold, those racists down there tried to secede from the United States to keep slavery alive and well!</p>
	<p>Of course, there is some truth in that narrative - the Civil War, even if not everyone wants to come to terms with this fact, was about slavery. It started because of slavery, and it ended legal slavery as an institution in the United States - that is, if we ignore the fact that the 13th Amendment states as a caveat: “except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.”</p>
	<p>However, the “morality” of the North is a more questionable aspect of this narrative. Most states in the Union during the war were, in fact, free states. But we often forget that there were also “border states”, states which still allowed slavery, but chose to remain in the Union: Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri. Later, West Virginia came to be after breaking from the rest of Virginia to be part of the Union (due to the way the war played out there). Additionally, the Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves in the rebel states; those still enslaved in the five border states remained that way until either the state abolished slavery during the war, or the 13th Amendment was ratified.</p>
	<p>Besides all of this, of course, we should think about Northern industrialization, often considered crucial to the Union victory, but also rather important to the abolition of slavery. Slavery was not as economically viable in the industrial North as in the South (and I am not an economist or an economic historian, so I will not delve into this issue that I am sure is much more complex than I am presenting it here), so it sort of faded away. This idea of “fading” emphasizes the gradual nature of abolition in Northern states, as most of them passed laws that stated slavery would be illegal in a certain year, so you had until then to adjust. For example, the laws abolishing slavery in New York started with one in 1799 - those born after that year were free, but had to be indentured until young adulthood - and then another passed in 1817 - all slaves born after 1799 would be free in 1827 (information I personally did not encounter, as a native of upstate New York, until college).</p>
	<p><strong>Settling on a Project</p>
	<p>So this was the starting point of my part of this project: what does “the North” remember about its own history when it comes to slavery and the Civil War? Initially I was going to map all Civil War memorials in the Union, as compared to, say, civil rights-related memorials - which is a more prevalent part of public memory? However, after some research and some thinking, and changing my mind many times, I landed on mapping memorials, markers, monuments, and historic sites under three headings: slavery and abolition-related sites based around white people; slavery and abolition-related sites based around African Americans; and civil rights-related sites. I did this because what struck me as more important in the Northern narrative was, aside from some more famous African American figures like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, a privileging of the upstanding white abolitionists and activists over those who actually suffered from racism and bondage. And the more I thought about it, the more I thought, well of course there are going to be thousands of Civil War memorials, and they are all going to be about the soldiers, maybe some nurses or something along those lines. It was a war, and we always memorialize wars (with modern wars, more contested in the public and political sphere, perhaps being excluded from this). Is mapping this really going to contribute anything to how we think about the North and slavery? So I chose to leave out that section, despite having begun work on it already.</p>
	<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
	<p>Having settled on this - and even before doing so - I had to gather data from somewhere. I did this using a site called the <a href="http://www.hmdb.org/">Historical Marker Database</a> and searching through the data using the categories “Abolition & Underground RR”, “African Americans”, and “Civil Rights”, and going state by state. Although I was originally going to cover all the states in the Union, I rethought this based on the premise of my project, and instead decided to only include the states that seemed to be part of what we traditionally think of as the Northeast: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland. This did, therefore, include a couple of border states, but I felt that they were pretty much the “North”.</p>
	<p>Going through the data, I also excluded many listings that were simply markers unconnected to the place they were erected, except for the fact that something happened in that town, or if the marker was based on local folklore rather than research. I also excluded markers that said something along the lines of “Martin Luther King, Jr. spoke here once,” as I did not feel they were as relevant to what I was trying to visualize on this map. Additionally, I excluded many listings of churches and meetinghouses that mainly served a purpose other than memorialization. This meant that I often made very subjective decisions about whether or not to include something, which I am sure has skewed the data. Finally, categorization could sometimes be a bit tricky, as the lines could be blurred between what counts as an instance being memorialized that focuses more on the abolitionist rescuing the fugitive slave than on the slave zirself. Or, if someone lived long enough past the Civil War - as many did - to be involved in the fight for civil rights (not just in what we think of as the civil rights era, but post-Emancipation more generally), then what category should they really be put under? So again, I had to make several subjective decisions.</p>
	<p><strong>The Map</strong></p>
	<p>One of the aspects we can see on this map is just how minimal the data is, and just imagine how overwhelmed it would have been if I <em>had</em> included Civil War memorials on here! That, to me, says something about the focus of public memory and public history.</p>
	<p>Most of the data seems to be in Pennsylvania - especially Philadelphia - and New York. In New York, this may be due to the proximity to Canada - there were many Underground Railroad stations there (abbreviated “UR” in the “other” section of the pop-up information). In regards to this, it also seems in some spots like you can actually trace a sort of trail that some fugitive slaves may have taken. For Pennsylvania, it may be due to some sort of drive in the last couple of decades (based on the dates that many of these were erected) to recognize historic sites and events, as most of the markers were put up by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. Seemingly, the desire to recognize this aspect of history is more recent.</p>
	<p>Although I will admit there were a few markers I left out (because of a lack of explicit connection to any of my categories) that recognize that segregation existed in the North through the civil rights-era, there are very few markers that recognize efforts to establish equality in the North. To me, this is how the North often views itself - because it got rid of slavery earlier (for supposedly moral reasons), it does not need to worry about racism as much, and civil rights were a non-issue! It is difficult to address something that people do not think is a problem, and if we do not understand and acknowledge our own history, there is virtually no way to resolve present-day issues that resonate from our past.</p>
