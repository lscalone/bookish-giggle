	<h2>Public Memory and Street Naming Conventions in the South: Who’s History?</h2>
	<h4>By Caroline Klibanoff</h4>
	<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
	<p>In a region that is highly memorialized, such as the American South, there are often competing narratives that fight for domination of shared public spaces like monuments, parks, roadways, schools – even symbolic spaces like holidays and rituals. In the South, there have been two sea-change events that have used memorialization to shift the region’s culture and narrative: the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. The loss of the Civil War for the Confederacy erupted in what Charles Reagan Wilson called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Baptized-Blood-Religion-Cause-1865-1920/dp/0820334251">“the religion of the lost cause,”</a> an outpouring of worship and defenses of the Confederacy and the Southern “way of life,” often realized in public shrines to Confederate leaders like the ones carved into the face of <a href="http://orig07.deviantart.net/052a/f/2012/149/f/1/stone_mountain__georgia_by_deviantvicky-d51ibb5.jpg">Stone Mountain in Georgia.</a></p>
	<p>The Civil Rights Movement, far more recent, also gives the South a claim to fame as it celebrates the legacy of brave leaders who risked their lives in the struggle for equality, working, of course, against the key factor in the “way of life” those Confederate leaders had sought to defend – white supremacy. In recent years, Civil Rights tourism has erupted in the Southeast as sites of conflict have become memorials and museums.
	<p>How to compare these legacies? What is the primary narrative of the South today?
	<p>Street names provide a good proxy for a quantified analysis of public memory. Everyone uses them, they are maintained by government funds, and yet many times streets are named by private developers or community leaders, who may have their own agenda. As Edward Ayers writes:
	<blockquote>“The first thing we have to recognize about social memory is that it is inherently political; it is about defining us against them —whether the "us" is the nation-state, ethnic group, geographic population, family, or organization...Every group must tell a story to itself about itself, who it is and why it came to be, what memories it cherishes, why it deserves to be taken seriously and respected. Memory is more politically charged than almost anything historians can talk about right now.”

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
<p>Using 2014 street name data from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html">U.S. Census Tiger Line files</a>, I culled through 6.8 million street names using regular expressions to pull out streets named for the Confederacy and its leaders, and streets named for Civil Rights Movement leaders.
<p>I ran a case-sensitive regular expression search for these Confederate names, many of which I pulled from the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/20160421/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy">Southern Poverty Law Center</a>'s wonderful work cataloguing and mapping Confederate-named memorials (including roads and highways) across America. Their work, which found 1500 government-sponsored symbols of the Confederacy, inspired this project.

<p>I ran a case-sensitive regular expression search for these Civil Rights Movement names:
<p>Martin Luther King|Rosa Parks|Booker T Washington|M L King|M.L. King|Booker T. Washington|Thurgood|DuBois|Abernathy|Coretta Scott|C S King|Medgar Evers|Malcolm X|Shuttlesworth|Hosea Williams|Emmett Till|Jesse Jackson|Marcus Garvey|Booker T Washington|B T Washington|Liuzzo|James Meredith|Fannie Lou Hamer|Fannie Hamer|Claudette Colvin |C Colvin|James Forman |John Lewis |Bayard Rustin |Joseph Lowery|James Earl Chaney|JE Chaney|J E Chaney|J.E. Chaney|Jimmie Lee Jackson|Lemuel Penn|M Garvey</p>
<p>I have likely missed some names, and would welcome feedback on that. But I also decided to be conservative in my approach: unless I could confirm that a street was named for that particular person, and not some *other* Lee or King, I did not include it. Thus, the many, many streets named "Abernathy" and "Colvin"  for the most part were not included unless they included a first name (Ralph David Abernathy, or Claudette Colvin). I did the same for Lee, although it is important to note his family lineage (Washington and Lee, for example) is the reason many counties and streets are named "Lee." (In other words, it's still about <em>that</em> Lee, even if it's not about the Civil War).</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>Nationally, these two groups are about equally represented in terms of street names: across the United States there are 1426 streets named for Civil Rights Leaders and 1417 streets named for Confederate Leaders. But when we narrow it down to the South, things are...uh, the same. In the Southern states, there are 1132 streets named for Confederate leaders and 1118 named for Civil Rights leaders. About the same. Unsurprisingly, there are far more Confederate-named streets in Virginia; that was a primary battle site of the Civil War, and many generals were from the state of Virginia. Similarly, there are many more Civil Rights-named streets in Alabama, where more events of the movement take place and where more of the movement's leaders originated. Georgia, my home state, continues to be a hotbed of complicated heritage: as a primary site of both the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, it maintains its dual status by celebrating both legacies with streets named for both groups (slightly more for the Civil Rights Movement).</p>

<p>A comparison of streets named for Civil Rights leaders and Confederate leaders is not meant to be a direct comparison to the two historic events: one was a war, while the other was a nonviolent social movement; they occurred about 90-100 years apart; they didn't take place in the exact same states to the exact same extent. There is no use in comparing these two related events historically. However, the question of which dominates our present-day South in terms of felt presence, public feeling and shared memory is clearly an ongoing debate, and this map shows that the South is far from being settled one way or another on a dominant legacy.</p>
<p><strong>But wait: a bonus track! What about Dixie?</strong><p>
<p>There are 1,697 streets, not included in my analysis above, that use some form of “Dixie” in their name in the United States. Though “Dixie” as a nickname for the South has antebellum origins, it grew in popularity when the Confederacy adopted the song “I Wish I Was In Dixie” as their national hymn, and Abraham Lincoln <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9505E2D91738E033A25754C0A9649C946897D6CF">ordered the song to be played</a> at the war’s conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>“There is a song or a tune which I used to hear with great pleasure before the war, but our friends across the river have appropriated it to their use during the last four years. It is the tune called ‘Dixie.’ But I think we have captured it. At any rate, I conferred with the Attorney General this morning, and he expressed the opinion that ‘Dixie’ may fairly be regarded as captured property. So I shall be glad to hear ‘Dixie’ by the band.”</blockquote>
<p>Today, “Dixie” is considered perhaps an outmoded but still commonly-seen nickname, as nostalgic as it is divisive, representing an era and region where slavery reigned. But there’s no need for anyone to “wish they were in Dixie” – unless you live in North Dakota or Hawaii, the only U.S. states without a street named Dixie.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the South – the land of the Confederacy – has the most streets named Dixie, more than twice as many as the Midwest does, and about ten times as many as the North and West. Florida tops the list by state, perhaps because of Florida’s higher population (18.9 million in 2014, compared to Georgia’s second-highest 10 million, among Southern states). It is interesting to note Kentucky’s apparent rabid nostalgia for Dixieland – Kentucky was a border state in the Civil War and ultimately joined the Union side, and that as well as the state’s current-day sensibilities are why it is filed under “Midwest” rather than “South” in my analysis.</p>
<p>It is also interesting how evenly spread Dixie streets are in the South overall. Few towns have more than one.</p>
