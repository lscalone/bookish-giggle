	<h2>The Civil War Heritage of the American West</h2>
	<h4>By Luke Scalone</h4>
	<p>In this project, I created spreadsheets filled with the Civil War Monuments of the American West, playing special attention to which faction each monument expressed support for, if any.  My findings were surprising at some points, and unsurprising at others.</p>
	<p>First of all, I examined the states that were officially part of the United States of America and the Confederate States of America to see how they remembered their pasts.  Unsurprisingly, these states were dominated by monuments that commemorated the faction that each state was a part of.  Texas, for example, has an overwhelming number of monuments that commemorate the Confederacy, while most of California's monuments commemorate the Union.  Missouri was a more contested space.  While monuments relating to a faction tended to be in favor of the Confederacy, there were far more monuments that were erected in general rememberance of the Civil War.  I interpret this to mean that Missouri is not opposed to commemoration of the Union, it just doesn't like to express it outright.  Texas, on the other hand, has very few monuments about the Civil War more broadly, and nearly all are occupied with the heritage of the Confederacy.</p>
	<p>States that were not part of either faction during the Civil War have far fewer monuments than those that had achieved statehood.  North Dakota, for example, did not have any monuments that commemorate the Civil War.  Of the few monuments that exist in the West, most of them celebrate the contributions by the Union.  Indeed, a large number of them were erected by the Grand Army of the Republic, a Union veterans organization that was prominent in the United States in the decades following the Civil War.</p>  
	<p>Notable cases in the West are Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.  Arizona has far more Confederate monuments than the rest of the Western states, and it was a place where the Confederacy tried to claim more territory.  While normally unsuccessful, the state of Arizona still remembers the participation of the Confederacy in fighting the Civil War in the state.  New Mexico, on the other hand, is filled with Union monuments, in stark contrast to the states directly east and west of it.  I would argue that this is because the Union was overwhelmingly successful in defeating the South in the Battle of New Mexico.  As a result, the state adopts a more triumphant stance than other Western states could even need to.  Lastly, there is the case of Oklahoma, which has the highest number of monuments commemorating Native American involvement in the Civil War.  This makes sense, as Oklahoma was "Indian Territory" at the time of the War.  What I did not know before embarking on this project is that the Natives in Oklahoma overwhelmingly supported the Confederacy.  Given the Confederacy's heritage and involvement in racial strife, it emphasizes the importance of Native American combatants in order to portray itself as less "racist" than is commonly viewed in the American mainstream.  The other possibility is that the state of Oklahoma commemorates Native Americans for no other reason than their contributions.  This is entirely possible and it would be wrong of me to dismiss this idea.</p>
	<p>The biggest flairs in monuments appear to be in both Missouri and Kansas, where there was heavy fighting during the Civil War, and terrorism both during and before the war.  "Bleeding Kansas" was a name given to Kansas to describe the amount of violence taking place there, much of which was based in massacres rather than mutual fighting.</p>
